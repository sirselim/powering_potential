## Whole genome sequencing

### TED talk - 15 mins [(link)](https://www.ted.com/talks/riccardo_sabatini_how_to_read_the_genome_and_build_a_human_being?language=en)

> *Secrets, disease and beauty are all written in the human genome, the complete set of genetic instructions needed to build a human being. Now, as scientist and entrepreneur Riccardo Sabatini shows us, we have the power to read this complex code, predicting things like height, eye color, age and even facial structure -- all from a vial of blood. And soon, Sabatini says, our new understanding of the genome will allow us to personalize treatments for diseases like cancer. We have the power to change life as we know it. How will we use it?*

This TED talk covers several of the points and topics we discussed on the afternoon of the 16^th^ Dec 2019. Please use it only as a primer or refresher, it's just a snap shot of information presented from a single viewpoint.

### some selected articles/news/etc to get you started

##### What is genetic discrimination?

> Genetic discrimination occurs when people are treated differently by their employer or insurance company because they have a gene mutation that causes or increases the risk of an inherited disorder. Fear of discrimination is a common concern among people considering genetic testing.
>
> Several laws at the federal and state levels help protect people against genetic discrimination. In particular, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is designed to protect people from this form of discrimination.
>
> GINA has two parts: Title I, which prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance, and Title II, which prohibits genetic discrimination in employment. Title I makes it illegal for health insurance providers to use or require genetic information to make decisions about a person's insurance eligibility or coverage. This part of the law went into effect on May 21, 2009. Title II makes it illegal for employers to use a person's genetic information when making decisions about hiring, promotion, and several other terms of employment. This part of the law went into effect on November 21, 2009.
>
> GINA and other laws do not protect people from genetic discrimination in every circumstance. For example, GINA does not apply when an employer has fewer than 15 employees. GINA also does not protect against genetic discrimination in forms of insurance other than health insurance, such as life, disability, or long-term care insurance.

## Estonia genome project

> *Estonian Biobank and Personalised Medicine Initiative
Estonia launched a population based, voluntary, longitudinal prospective research oriented biobank in the year 2000 with a broad informed consent. The original biobank grew to 52,000 participants with a rapid increase in 2018 to 100,000 participants. Linking health data resources is currently ongoing. Main genetic feedback use cases have been focussed around polygenic risk scores for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, and early menopause. A recent pharmacogenetic use case established that almost everyone carries a variant of some of the drug metabolising genes that would require change of dosage for at least some drug. A cascading recall study has been performed for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic variant carriers. Based on such successes the implementation of linking the genetic data to health IT systems is being planned on the national level.*

## SING Aotearoa (https://www.singaotearoa.nz/) - Summer Internship for Indigenous Genomics Aotearoa

> *The SING Aotearoa programme is designed to develop indigenous understanding of genomics alongside some of the best researchers in New Zealand and the world.  It is a week-long residential internship programme providing participants with knowledge and experience in wet-labs (biological samples, DNA), dry labs (computer analysis, biostatistics) and simulation labs (cultural and ethical scenarios).
>
> Significant advances in the fields of genetics and genomics sees an increasing focus on Maori populations and indigenous species. Research conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand should involve consultation with Iwi Māori and it is important that Māori understand the technical, ethical and cultural issues when engaging with researchers in these projects.*
