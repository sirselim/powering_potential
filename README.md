## Genomics Aotearoa

> *Genomics Aotearoa is an agile, leading-edge and collaborative platform, established to ensure that New Zealand is internationally participating and leading in the rapidly developing fields of genomics (the study of the genome, the complete set of genetic material present in a cell or organism) and bioinformatics (the development of methods and software tools for understanding the biological data derived from genomics). *

## Te-Mata-Ira-Genome-Research-Guidelines

> *Māori ethical frameworks recognise that all research in New Zealand is of interest to Māori and outline community expectations of appropriate behaviour in research to deliver the best outcomes for Māori.*

## Rakeiora: A pathfinder for genomic medicine in Aotearoa/New Zealand

> *A programme to improve genomic knowledge that will impact on the wellbeing of New Zealanders is being co-developed and co-governed with Māori. It is a “pathfinder” to test options to acquire, protect, use and store genomic datasets for use in healthcare research in Aotearoa New Zealand.*

## Estonia genome project

> *Estonian Biobank and Personalised Medicine Initiative
Estonia launched a population based, voluntary, longitudinal prospective research oriented biobank in the year 2000 with a broad informed consent. The original biobank grew to 52,000 participants with a rapid increase in 2018 to 100,000 participants. Linking health data resources is currently ongoing. Main genetic feedback use cases have been focussed around polygenic risk scores for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, and early menopause. A recent pharmacogenetic use case established that almost everyone carries a variant of some of the drug metabolising genes that would require change of dosage for at least some drug. A cascading recall study has been performed for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic variant carriers. Based on such successes the implementation of linking the genetic data to health IT systems is being planned on the national level.*

### ELIXIR Estonia (https://elixir.ut.ee/)

> *The purpose of ELIXIR is to construct and operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to support life science research and its translation to medicine and the environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.*
