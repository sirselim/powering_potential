## The Human Genome Project

#### Then

* a 13-year-long, publicly funded project
  * initiated in 1990
  * 'completed' 2003
  * so 13 years total (was estimated to be 15 years)

* the human genome is ~3,234.83 Mb (**3.2 billion base pairs**)

* the project cost ~$3 billion USD
  * that equates to roughly $1 per base pair

* the 'completed' genome was a mosaic, i.e. a combination of multiple different genomes from donors

* this was a massive international collaborative effort featuring MANY people, institutes, technologies, etc.

#### Now

* with todays technology it's possible to sequence a whole genome in <24 hrs

* it's approaching the $1000 USD per genome mark for cost

* we're approaching the point where this can be down on a 'tiny' portable device

## Whole genome sequencing

### TED talk - 15 mins [(link)](https://www.ted.com/talks/riccardo_sabatini_how_to_read_the_genome_and_build_a_human_being?language=en)

> *Secrets, disease and beauty are all written in the human genome, the complete set of genetic instructions needed to build a human being. Now, as scientist and entrepreneur Riccardo Sabatini shows us, we have the power to read this complex code, predicting things like height, eye color, age and even facial structure -- all from a vial of blood. And soon, Sabatini says, our new understanding of the genome will allow us to personalize treatments for diseases like cancer. We have the power to change life as we know it. How will we use it?*

This TED talk covers several of the points and topics we discussed on the afternoon of the 16<sup>th^</sup> Dec 2019. Please use it only as a primer or refresher, it's just a snap shot of information presented from a single viewpoint.

### some selected articles/news/etc to get you started

#### What were some of the ethical, legal, and social implications addressed by the Human Genome Project?

Below from [here](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/hgp/elsi):

The Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990 as an integral part of the Human Genome Project. The mission of the ELSI program was to identify and address issues raised by genomic research that would affect individuals, families, and society. A percentage of the Human Genome Project budget at the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Energy was devoted to ELSI research.

The ELSI program focused on the possible consequences of genomic research in four main areas:

* Privacy and fairness in the use of genetic information, including the potential for genetic discrimination in employment and insurance.
* The integration of new genetic technologies, such as genetic testing, into the practice of clinical medicine.
* Ethical issues surrounding the design and conduct of genetic research with people, including the process of informed consent.
* The education of healthcare professionals, policy makers, students, and the public about genetics and the complex issues that result from genomic research.

* **Routine DNA Sequencing May Be Helpful And Not As Scary As Feared**: [link](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/26/534338576/routine-dna-sequencing-may-be-helpful-and-not-as-scary-as-feared)
* **Reconceptualizing harms and benefits in the genomic age**: [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6295320/)
* **Age and perceived risks and benefits of preventive genomic screening**: [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215654)

##### Benefits and implications of learning about your DNA

> *Personal genome sequencing is uncharted waters in our society. The benefits and implications of sequencing are likely to be connected, complex, and largely unknowable until years have passed and the consequences are examined across several generations. However, thinking through the issues surrounding personal genomics now, rather than later, may help to avoid potential pitfalls and ensure that the good outweighs the bad.*  
> *[link](https://pged.org/benefits-and-risks-of-learning-about-your-dna/)*

##### facial recognition

* **Facial recognition from DNA using face-to-DNA classifiers**: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10617-y)

* **How Accurately Can Scientists Reconstruct A Person’s Face From DNA?**: [link](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-accurately-can-scientists-reconstruct-persons-face-from-dna-180968951/)
> *Predicting physical features from genetic data certainly has its limitations, but it is advancing. What does this mean for our privacy?*

##### insurance

* **Genetic testing, insurance discrimination and medical research: what the United States can learn from peer countries**: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0534-z)

* **What You Should Know About Insurance Before You Have Genetic Testing?**: [link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenmatloff/2019/06/26/what-you-should-know-about-insurance-before-you-have-genetic-testing/#36aff9c65734)

* **Genetic Risk in Insurance Field**: [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110137/)

##### What is genetic discrimination?

> *Genetic discrimination occurs when people are treated differently by their employer or insurance company because they have a gene mutation that causes or increases the risk of an inherited disorder. Fear of discrimination is a common concern among people considering genetic testing.*
>
> *Several laws at the federal and state levels help protect people against genetic discrimination. In particular, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is designed to protect people from this form of discrimination.*
>
> *GINA has two parts: Title I, which prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance, and Title II, which prohibits genetic discrimination in employment. Title I makes it illegal for health insurance providers to use or require genetic information to make decisions about a person's insurance eligibility or coverage. This part of the law went into effect on May 21, 2009. Title II makes it illegal for employers to use a person's genetic information when making decisions about hiring, promotion, and several other terms of employment. This part of the law went into effect on November 21, 2009.*
>
> *GINA and other laws do not protect people from genetic discrimination in every circumstance. For example, GINA does not apply when an employer has fewer than 15 employees. GINA also does not protect against genetic discrimination in forms of insurance other than health insurance, such as life, disability, or long-term care insurance.*

## Estonia genome project

> *Estonian Biobank and Personalised Medicine Initiative
Estonia launched a population based, voluntary, longitudinal prospective research oriented biobank in the year 2000 with a broad informed consent. The original biobank grew to 52,000 participants with a rapid increase in 2018 to 100,000 participants. Linking health data resources is currently ongoing. Main genetic feedback use cases have been focussed around polygenic risk scores for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, and early menopause. A recent pharmacogenetic use case established that almost everyone carries a variant of some of the drug metabolising genes that would require change of dosage for at least some drug. A cascading recall study has been performed for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic variant carriers. Based on such successes the implementation of linking the genetic data to health IT systems is being planned on the national level.*

## Taonga genomes

> *Taonga species are native birds, plants and animals of special cultural significance and importance to Māori.*

* older blog post but still very relevant (from the now director of Genomics Aotearoa): [link](https://sciblogs.co.nz/genomics-aotearoa/2015/07/26/taonga-genomes/)

* the kiwi genome was sequenced in 2015: [link](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0711-4)

## SING Aotearoa ([link](https://www.singaotearoa.nz/))

**Summer Internship for Indigenous Genomics Aotearoa**

> *The SING Aotearoa programme is designed to develop indigenous understanding of genomics alongside some of the best researchers in New Zealand and the world.  It is a week-long residential internship programme providing participants with knowledge and experience in wet-labs (biological samples, DNA), dry labs (computer analysis, biostatistics) and simulation labs (cultural and ethical scenarios).*
>
> *Significant advances in the fields of genetics and genomics sees an increasing focus on Maori populations and indigenous species. Research conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand should involve consultation with Iwi Māori and it is important that Māori understand the technical, ethical and cultural issues when engaging with researchers in these projects.*
