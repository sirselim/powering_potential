## Whole genome sequencing

### quick TED talk (https://www.ted.com/talks/riccardo_sabatini_how_to_read_the_genome_and_build_a_human_being?language=en)

> *Secrets, disease and beauty are all written in the human genome, the complete set of genetic instructions needed to build a human being. Now, as scientist and entrepreneur Riccardo Sabatini shows us, we have the power to read this complex code, predicting things like height, eye color, age and even facial structure -- all from a vial of blood. And soon, Sabatini says, our new understanding of the genome will allow us to personalize treatments for diseases like cancer. We have the power to change life as we know it. How will we use it?*

This TED talk covers several of the points and topics we discussed on the afternoon of the 16^th^ Dec 2019.

## Genomics Aotearoa

> *Genomics Aotearoa is an agile, leading-edge and collaborative platform, established to ensure that New Zealand is internationally participating and leading in the rapidly developing fields of genomics (the study of the genome, the complete set of genetic material present in a cell or organism) and bioinformatics (the development of methods and software tools for understanding the biological data derived from genomics). *

## Te-Mata-Ira-Genome-Research-Guidelines

> *Māori ethical frameworks recognise that all research in New Zealand is of interest to Māori and outline community expectations of appropriate behaviour in research to deliver the best outcomes for Māori.*

## The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (https://www.ga4gh.org/)

**Enabling responsible genomic data sharing for the benefit of human health**

> *The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing [within a human rights framework](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/framework-for-responsible-sharing-of-genomic-and-health-related-data/).*

## Rakeiora: A pathfinder for genomic medicine in Aotearoa/New Zealand

> *A programme to improve genomic knowledge that will impact on the wellbeing of New Zealanders is being co-developed and co-governed with Māori. It is a “pathfinder” to test options to acquire, protect, use and store genomic datasets for use in healthcare research in Aotearoa New Zealand.*

## Estonia genome project

> *Estonian Biobank and Personalised Medicine Initiative
Estonia launched a population based, voluntary, longitudinal prospective research oriented biobank in the year 2000 with a broad informed consent. The original biobank grew to 52,000 participants with a rapid increase in 2018 to 100,000 participants. Linking health data resources is currently ongoing. Main genetic feedback use cases have been focussed around polygenic risk scores for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, and early menopause. A recent pharmacogenetic use case established that almost everyone carries a variant of some of the drug metabolising genes that would require change of dosage for at least some drug. A cascading recall study has been performed for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic variant carriers. Based on such successes the implementation of linking the genetic data to health IT systems is being planned on the national level.*

### ELIXIR Estonia (https://elixir.ut.ee/)

> *The purpose of ELIXIR is to construct and operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to support life science research and its translation to medicine and the environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.*

## Taonga genomes

> *Taonga species are native birds, plants and animals of special cultural significance and importance to Māori.*

## SING Aotearoa (https://www.singaotearoa.nz/) - Summer Internship for Indigenous Genomics Aotearoa

> *The SING Aotearoa programme is designed to develop indigenous understanding of genomics alongside some of the best researchers in New Zealand and the world.  It is a week-long residential internship programme providing participants with knowledge and experience in wet-labs (biological samples, DNA), dry labs (computer analysis, biostatistics) and simulation labs (cultural and ethical scenarios).
>
> Significant advances in the fields of genetics and genomics sees an increasing focus on Maori populations and indigenous species. Research conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand should involve consultation with Iwi Māori and it is important that Māori understand the technical, ethical and cultural issues when engaging with researchers in these projects.*
